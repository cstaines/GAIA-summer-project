sorted_lists/: contains list of RECONS stars in descending S/N.

config_files/: contains files with which Hannu's NEAT code can be run.

test_data/: contains test data sets created from the configuration files.

RECONS_gaia_test/: contains .fits files in which the results from gaia_search.py are stored.
